<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>2 2/3 cups (320 g.) all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
	<li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
	<li>3/4 cup (150 g.) packed light brown sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 cup (100 g.) granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 cup (170 g.) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
	<li>1 cup (120 g.) coarsely chopped chocolate wafers or discs (or from a bar), preferably 70% cacao or higher</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Step 1<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt until combined.</li>
<li>Step 2<br>
In a large bowl, whisk butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until combined and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla and whisk to combine. Add dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until about halfway mixed in. Add chips and wafers and fold until just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 24.</li>
<li>Step 3<br>
Let dough come to room temperature. Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350Â°. Using a large cookie scoop (about 3 Tbsp.), scoop dough onto 2-parchment lined baking sheets, spacing about 3" apart.</li>
<li>Step 4<br>
Bake cookies, rotating trays to top bottom halfway through, until edges are golden brown and just set and centers are almost set, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly.</li>
